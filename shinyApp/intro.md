# Welcome

University of Washington students don't really know what they're
getting when they choose their classes. If we're lucky, we may find good professor
reviews on [RateMyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/). Or perhaps,
some word-of-mouth talk about how murderous the curve is. Our solution is this application.
We want students to leave our site understanding how their choice of professor/course could
result in joy or misery...

## This application's purpose: to guide UW Students through course data. 

They can discover: 

- **What quarter a course is offered**
- **A professor's class history**
- **Trends in student enrollment between quarters**
- **High-level trends in overall GPA**


    
## We address some key questions students may have
    
  1. **Will I do well in X course?**
  2. **Do students in professor Y's class do better than in professor Z's?**
  3. **Is this course offered when I want it to?**
    
By visualizing the course information from 2011 to 2016,
our team seeks to answer these questions *(and more)* succinctly.
